# About

This is _example_ documentation for in-text citations and reference styles used in TWRI reports.

## Reccomended Usage 


### In-Text References

- One author: name with year (Smith 2008) 
- Two authors: name and name with year (Smith and Jones 2009) 
- Three authors: name et al. with year (Smith et al. 2010) 

### End References

End references follow Chicago Manual of Style, examples are available at: http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html#cg-journal.

**General Rules:** 

Authors: List up to 10 authors in the reference list. If there are more than 10 authors, list the first seven with et al. at end, e.g., Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Starr, Clapton, Hendrix, Joplin, et al. 

Journal article and report titles: In an exception to CMOS, use sentence case, not title case. Do not use quotation marks around article titles.  

Journal names: In an exception to CMOS, do not italicize journal names. 

Dates: If there is no date, use n.d. for year. 

## Bibliography Managers

There are multiple bibliography managers available to manage and format references. [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) use Citation Style Language (`.csl`) files to format references. A `.csl` file specific to TWRI's in-house reference style is available on [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TxWRI/csl/main/texas-water-journal-name-year.csl).
